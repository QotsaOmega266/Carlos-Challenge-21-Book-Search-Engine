# Carlos-Challenge-21-Book-Search-Engine

The purpose of this app is to create a search engine for finding books with the use of GraphQL queries, Apollo Server, MongoDB, Node.js/Express.js, and many other aspect sthat we learned over this course. Unfortunately, I havent fully finished the program since I was still working on the schemas portion of the code as well as getting some npm commands to run properly.
